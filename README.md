# SRNN
Code for the paper [*Symplectic Recurrent Neural Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13334), which appeared in ICLR 2020. 

By unrolling a Hamiltonian system with a neural-network-parametrized Hamiltonian function using the leapfrog integrator, and together with initial state optimization, our model is able to learn the dynamics of complex, noisy and stiff physical systems.
